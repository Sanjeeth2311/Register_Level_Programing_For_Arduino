# Register-Level Programming on Arduino

This project demonstrates **register-level (low-level) programming** on Arduino Uno (ATmega328P).  
Instead of using Arduino built-in functions like `digitalWrite` or `pinMode`, this approach directly manipulates **microcontroller registers** to control hardware.

## About

- **Board Used:** Arduino Mega 
- **Programming Style:** Register-level (bare-metal)  
- **Why Register-Level Programming?**  
  - Faster execution compared to Arduino functions  
  - Provides precise control over hardware  
  - Helps understand microcontroller architecture and fundamentals

## How It Works

Register-level programming involves configuring **microcontroller registers** such as:  
- **Data Direction Registers (DDR):** Set pins as input or output  
- **PORT Registers:** Write HIGH or LOW values to pins  
- **Timer/Counters:** Generate PWM signals, delays, or measure time  
- **Interrupt Registers:** Handle events asynchronously  

This approach is ideal for learning **embedded systems** and optimizing performance in projects.
